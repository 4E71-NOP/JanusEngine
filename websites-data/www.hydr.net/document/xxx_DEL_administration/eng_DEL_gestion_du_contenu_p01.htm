The content is organized with several concepts. 
</p>
<h3>Introducing document and article hierarchy</h3>
<p>
A document is depending on an article to be displayed. A document can be assembled dynamicly with other documents. An article is depending on a 'deadline' to be displayed. A category (menu) allows acces to the document.
</p>
<h3>The documents</h3>
<p>
The real content lies in the documents. This is the only place where it should be. The documents are able to include (&#91;INCLUDE&#93;xxxx&#91;/INCLUDE&#93;) other documents. So one can create a document solely based on other documents. It is useful for content that is repeated on several pages or for a 'legend' that accompany the original document.
</p>
<p>
In this context, changing one document will make changes visible on all the documents that include this one.
</p>
<h3>The articles</h3>
<p>
The article allow to refer to a document (logical link). It looks like a folders where we put documents and give a configuration to it (layout, menu type, deadline etc.). Articles are to be validated by editors (or validators; depends on tong)and be linked with a valid deadline, in order to be displayed. Ex: If an article is valid but the deadline is tagged 'offline'. You won't be able to see the article on the website when browsing it.
</p>
<h3>The deadlines</h3>
<p>
The deadlines are responssible for the display of category and articles. So you can control when an article (and menu) is accessible on the website. Ex: A game that has a precise end time. When reaching the end of the period, the article will not be online anymore.
</p>
<p>
You can even produce articles that look alike closely and swap them when time is up. Ex: Information that cannot be released before a given time.
