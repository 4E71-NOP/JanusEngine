<h3>Les thèmes (ou skin)</h3>

These elements are like some sort of directories that link to decorations. These also define the use of CSS stylesheet files, logos (blason module), or some element of the administration panel. Each theme is linked with only one website. 
There are no sharing option for themes. In the mean time use of scripts facilitate the copy to another website.

<code>
> block_01_name 'one_block_001'		block_01_text	'one_texte_001'<br>
block_02_name 'one_block_002'		block_02_text	'one_texte_002'<br>
etc.<br>
