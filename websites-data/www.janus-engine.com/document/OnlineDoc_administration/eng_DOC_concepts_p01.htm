<h3>Users</h3>
<p>
The user managment is based on a hierarchy. Each user is a member of one or several groups. The group will determine what users will see and what users will be able to do.
</p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>
The groups are important because they are linked to the menus. One menu only allows one group. If a user is not a member of a designated group by a menu, the associated menu will not be displayed. 
</p>
<p>
There are 3 group types
</p>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous : is the default group for any user that is not authenticated.</li>
<li>Reader : is the type for registered users.</li>
<li>Staff : is the type for registered users that have special access to the website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Catégories</h3>
<p>
The menus are the elements that make possible the menu forge. Each menu is linked to a group that will be able to see the menu defined. The menus also define the article associated with the menu entry.
