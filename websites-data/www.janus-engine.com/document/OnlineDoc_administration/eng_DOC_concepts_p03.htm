<h3>Les thèmes (ou skin)</h3>
<p>
	These elements are like some sort of directories that link to decorations. These also define the use of CSS

	one website.
	There are no sharing option for themes. In the mean time use of scripts facilitate the copy to another website.
	To understand this system you must understand how the website works. When a page is browsed, the engine will search
	for module to render. Each module defnine if there is a decoration to render and what is its number. The theme
	contains definitions that are compatible with this system.
